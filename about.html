        <p>
            Hello! I'm Marcela Adiao. I am currently a student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology,
            pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. I am a member of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)
            and ACM (Association for Computing Machinery). I am interested in data science, UX design, and quantum computing,
            but I am always ready to learn and engage in all sorts of facets of computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
            I first developed my interest in computer science in high school in my “Exploring Computer Science” class.
            For a couple of summers within high school, I was a camp counselor for my town’s local week long STEAM Camp.
            I enjoyed helping children learn about programming and robotics, well also helping them get their ideas to fruition.
            Also, throughout my academic career I’ve had a large interest in math, physics, and their connections to computer science.
            Such interests have led me to my fascinations with data science and quantum computing.
            I personally find psychology and story-telling very compelling. I am currently taking an introductory UX design course.
            UX is at the intersection of computer science, psychology, story-telling, and design. I hope to learn more about UX design in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, in the future, I would really like to help young women and people of color develop their interest in computer science.
            As a woman of color (I’m Filipino and Puerto Rican), I believe in the importance of representation and giving back to the communities
            that helped make me the person I am today. I also believe in the significance of helping under-represented groups within the STEM fields.
            I thoroughly enjoy both teaching and learning and want to cultivate those skills throughout my life.
        </p>
